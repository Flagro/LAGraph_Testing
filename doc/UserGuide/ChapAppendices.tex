\chapter{Revision history}
\label{Chp:RevHistory}
%--------------------------------------------------------------

This document defines the LAGraph 1.0 release and hence one could argue that there should not be a
revision history just yet.    Early pre-release versions of LAGraph, however, have been heavily used.  
We therefore need to summarize the key changes from the pre-release version of LAGraph and 
the official, 1.0 release.  
Changes in 1.0 (Released: 12 September 2022):
\begin{itemize}
\item We did a global redefinition of return codes to be more consistent and to mesh better with the GraphBLAS
return codes.
\item In the pre-release LAGraph library, we included type information on the LAGraph graph object.  We have
deprecated this feature since it is safer to use the type introspection from GraphBLAS than to carry distinct type
information inside the LAGraph  object.
\end{itemize}
